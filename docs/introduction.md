Hardware Accelerated Animations with boring CSS properties.  

## What?
- CSS sizing and positioning properties are great to design for the web. But their performance is terrible with animations.  
- CSS transform properties are great to animate elements. But they are hard to work with in the real world.  

Teleporter is a small utility that enables you to animate elements with 'transform', while defining their size and position with usual CSS properties.

Original inspiration comes from the hack explained by Paul Lewis: [FLIP Your Animations](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/).
