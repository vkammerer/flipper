Teleporter is a small library that animates DOM elements with "transform", while getting their size and position from usual CSS properties (properties that trigger the 'Layout' or 'Paint' phases of the [browser rendering pipeline](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/)).

Original inspiration comes from the hack explained by Paul Lewis: [FLIP Your Animations](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/).
